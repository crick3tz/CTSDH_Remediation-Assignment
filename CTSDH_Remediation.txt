Of course we all know the 300 logo. Composed by the blood of the warriors. What’s fascinating to me about that blood splatter, is how in digital film, it not only mimics the graphic novel but actually makes the view hyper-aware of the camera in how it often “covers” the lens. Different than first-person POV shots when the camera is “violated”, in remediations of graphic novels, this stylized spatter draws attention to both its cartoon-y, over-stylized source, but also the medium of film. I call this hypermediacy the Miller Effect of breaking the 4th Wall. It’s not limited to adaptations/remediations of Miller’s work. It’s even used often in later seasons of the Walking Dead. Surprisingly, however, i haven’t seen it used in any comic book films of late - though, to be fair, i’ve only seen a few.
